Some common commands to use in the Git Bash Shell (remember Directory and FileNames are CaSeSensiTive):

Print Working Directory:

   pwd

List Directory contents:

   ls
   
Change Directory to a directory in the current directory:

   cd DirectoryName

Change Directory to an absolute path:

   cd /c/Some/Directory/Path
   
Make a new directory:

   mkdir NewDirectoryName
   
Copy a file:

   cp /c/Some/Path/file /c/Some/Other/Path/newfile
  
Remove a file (there are no backsies on this, so be careful!!!!!):

   rm filename

To recursively remove everything in an entire directory (VERY DANGEROUS):

  rm -r DirectoryName
